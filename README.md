# Billing ERP Starter (React + TypeScript + Vite)

Minimal ERP-like billing web app with localStorage mock backend.

- Customers
- Products
- Invoices (with GST calc)
- Sales report
- Basic auth (mock)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

## Notes

- Data is stored in **localStorage** (for demo). Replace services/\* with real API calls later.
- To reset data, clear browser localStorage for this site.
